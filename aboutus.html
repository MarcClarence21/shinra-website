   <div class="story">
   	<h2>Marc Clarence Sangcap founded the 141 team, and the first two members were Brian Osorio and <br>John Marvin Pasco. He founded it when they were in the PYB clan. They added Michael Ivan, <br>Reynald Gayanes, and Andrei Marvilla because they were members of PYB, but they didn't have a team.<br> And as the days went by, they found new members such as Ken Seth Panolino, Gin Rayo,<br> and Mark Aron Pasco. Ken Seth was the cousin of Shimae Palla from the 69 team,<br> while Mark Aron Pasco is John Marvin's brother. Gin Rayo (the Stalkers Team Captain) was a <br>random player met by Marc Clarence and John Marvin when they were playing Battle Royale. Luckily, <br>Gin Rayo didn't have a clan or a team that day, so they had a chance to invite him to their team. <br>As time goes on, they have added new members such as Ceege Rosimo, Joshua Gutierrez, Jerome Gutierrez,<br> and Lemuel Osden. Ceege Rosimo, Lemuel Osden, and Joshua Gutierrez are Brian Osorio's friends,<br> while Jerome Gutierrez is Joshua's cousin. They also added Mark Keenjie. Mark Keenjie is from the 420 team, <br>but sadly, his teammates are not cooperating with each other, so they decided to disband it. When the time <br>came for the clan master to merge with another clan, the members of PYB and ERROR had a big<br> misunderstanding, resulting in 141 members leaving the PYB clan.<br> <img src="1.jpg" style="width:500px; height: 500px;margin-left: px;border-radius:10px; "><img src="2.jpg" style="border-radius:10px;width:600px; height: 350px;margin-left: 30px; "><br>Marc Clarence, Brian Osorio, and John Marvin along with Mark Aron Pasco, Ken Seth, Gin Rayo and<br> Joshua Gutierrez decided to create a new clan, which is now Shinra Esports. They create shinra esports in <br>order to meet new people and make new memories.Â While the shinra is growing, Brian Osorio adds<br> his friend from the game Mobile Legends, Nala Deva Cervantes; Joshua also adds<br> his cousin, Jan Vincent Gutierrez; and Gin Rayo adds his siblings, Delgen Rayo and Angel Rayo.<br> He also adds his friends, such as Maoie De Guzman, Elai, and Jay Dizon. They added Gabriel Villanueva,<br> Janwin Tuazon, and Johnlei Calivo.</h2>
